## What is this?
A load testing tool for Meteor applications.

** <b>Important!</b> Please don't load test sites running on meteor.com! Use your own servers! ** 
If you need to run on external servers, see another service such as https:www.loadview-testing.com/

You can watch a video presentation about this from Meteor DevShop here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCPBGVI3PdA

This tool utilizes [the Grinder](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/) to manage agents which execute a customized test script capable of speaking DDP with the target Meteor server.  Each agent simulates 1 or more client connections and records performance metrics.

Users can configure options such as:
 * Meteor methods to call with parameters
 * Meteor subscriptions to initiate with parameters
 * User login via email/pass or resumeTokens (for OAUTH)
 * Number of clients to simulate
 * Wait time between thread start
 * Client ramp-up (process increment)

## Preliminaries
<b>Install pre-req's</b>
  * Java
  * [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 
    * *Note: make sure you use leiningen version 2+, which you can get by using the installation
      script from the web page. Some package managers, such as Debian/Ubuntu, will give you an older v1 version 
      which will result in `Could not find or load main class` errors. You can check which version of 
      leiningen you have by running `lein --version`.*

<b>Setup the project</b>

```bash
git clone git://github.com/alanning/meteor-load-test.git
cd meteor-load-test
lein deps  # downloads dependencies
```

## Running Tests

There are three parts to running your load tests:
  1. The system you are testing
  2. The agents which execute the test script
  3. A console which manages all the agents


## The System Under Test (SUT)
<b>To start an example server</b>

```bash
cd sut
./run
```

<b>Open app in browser</b>

http://localhost:3000/


## The Grinder

The Grinder is organized into two tiers: 
  * the console, which controls agents and distributes the test scripts, and 
  * the agents, which execute the tests and report back to the console.  
 
The console sends the configuration and test scripts to the agents, on demand, so 
modifying your tests and re-executing is straight-forward.  Each agent can 
start multiple processes and each process can run your test script multiple
times so generating a large amount of load is quite efficient.  

 Number of simulated clients = agents * processes * threads

 Each thread (client) will: 

  1. Request initial payload
  2. Request css & scripts found in initial response
  3. Initiate DDP connection
  4. Login with randomized user credentials (if supplied)
  5. Subscribe to subscriptions specified
  6. Perform method calls 'runs' number of times (see working.properties)

<br />


<b>To start an agent</b>

```bash
# in meteor-load-test directory
bin/grinder agent start [optional host url of console - defaults to localhost]
```

<b>Monitor agent log file</b>

```bash
# in separate console window, from meteor-load-test directory
cd log
tail -f agent_1.log
```

<b>To start the console</b>

```bash
# in separate console window, from meteor-load-test directory
bin/grinder console start
```

<b>To run tests</b>

In the Script tab, set the root directory to $PROJECT_HOME/grinder

Select `working.properties` and set it as the properties file to use (the star button)

Open `working.properties` and adjust as appropriate.  Default setup will load test http://localhost:3000/

Click the play button in the top left (tooltip says, "Start the worker processes")

In the results tab, you should see test results


## How to use

Modify `working.properties` as appropriate. See the [Grinder documentation](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/properties.html) for more options

Grinder agents should be started on separate boxes (not your webserver).

Note: Currently collection updates are received via Meteor subscriptions but there are no metrics gathered for how long it takes an update to be delivered under load.  The closest we have right now is peak and mean TPS for DDP calls.

Given that, probably the most realistic way to test responsiveness of your app under load is to spin up your agents, kick off the tests, wait for them to saturate your server, and then visit your site via your own browser.


## Controlling a remote agent

You will probably want to spin up agents on cloud machines so here's a couple useful things related to that:

1. Install java, leiningen, and `meteor-load-test` on all cloud instances and your local machine
2. Start console on local machine: `$ bin/grinder console start`
3. SSH into cloud instances and remote forward port 6372:
```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/creds.pem -R 6372:localhost:6372 ec2-user@10.0.0.1
```
4. Start agents on each cloud instance:
  ```
  $ ssh <cloud instance>
  $ bin/grinder agent start
  ```
5. Use grinder console to distribute properties script and start tests.  Probably want to delete `sut/.meteor/local` first.


## Terminology

Source: Goranka Bjedov, [Google Tech Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=335LKIXRauA&feature=gv)

Performance Testing
  * given load X, how quickly will the system return a result
  * timing

Stress Testing
  * when will the system fail and how will it fail
  * under what load will the system fail

Load Test
  * 80% of max load, what happens if run load for long period of time

Scalability
  * if I increase a certain resource, how will my through-put change

Performance Profiling
  * used for very specific drill-down

Reliability Testing
  * run load for 72+ hours
  * five 'nines'

Availability Testing
  * if a system fails, how quickly will the system come back online

Why test Performance?
  * Can our system return results as fast as customers want?
  * To prove stats for agreements
  * Peace of mind

Why NOT to test Performance?
  * functional testing


## Future work

Create Chef or Pallet scripts to automate creation of Grinder agent instances in the cloud

Explore recording timing information for length of time to finish receiving all collection updates
